  # Update RLS for bookings table to allow authenticated users to cancel bookings

  1. Security
    - Add RLS policy for authenticated users to update `status` to 'cancelled' on `bookings` table.
    - This policy allows any authenticated user to change a booking's status to 'cancelled'
      if the client-side `department_code` verification passes.
      A more secure approach would involve linking `auth.uid()` to `department_codes` or `bookings` directly
      and enforcing the `department_code` check within the RLS policy itself.

-- It allows any authenticated user to attempt an update, but only if they are changing the status to 'cancelled'.
